= Box 2D Notes =

== Data ==

 * world:
  * A collection of the following.

  * '''body:'''
   * A chunk of matter.

   * '''fixture:'''
    * Material properties.

   * '''shape:'''
    * A geometric object.

  * '''constraint:'''
   * Limits the motion of bodies.

   * '''joint:'''
    * Holds two or more bodies together.

   * '''joint limit:'''
    * Limits the range of motion of a joint.

   * '''joint motor:'''
    * Drives the motion of a joint.

== Modules ==

 * '''common'''
  * '''collision'''
   * '''dynamics'''

== Units ==

 * Box2D is tuned for MKS units.
 * Keep the size of moving objects between 0.1 and 10 meters.

== Simulation ==

 * A variable time step produces variable results.
 * Don't tie the time step to your frame rate.

 * There are two phases in the constraint solver:
  * '''Velocity Phase:''' 
   * The solver computes the impulses necessary for the bodies to move correctly.
  * '''Position Phase:'''
   * The solver adjusts the positions of the bodies to reduce overlap and joint detachment.

 * The suggested iteration count for Box2D is 10 for both velocity and position.
  * Using fewer iterations increases performance but accuracy suffers.
  * Using more iterations decreases performance but improves the quality of your simulation.
